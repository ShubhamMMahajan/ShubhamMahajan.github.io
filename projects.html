						<h2>Projects</h2>
						<p>These are the major projects I have done since my junior year of high school</p>

					<h3>CodeDay Spring 2015</h3>
					<p>Here my team and I built a multiplayer foosball game and ran it using twitch servers.
					   We built the game using a game engine called Construct 2 and we connected it to the 
					   servers using python. </p>	
					<h3>Cisco Internship</h3>
					<p>I had the opportunity to work in Cisco Systems after my junior year in high school 
					   During my internship, I had to create an Infrastructure Inventory Management web
					   application using HTML, JSP, Java, and MongoDB. This application was meant to be a
					   Mean Stack Application. I was in charge of connecting the application to the database
					   and creating a basic user interface</p>
					<h3>Kim's Academy Website</h3>
					<p>I created a website for Kim's Academy. I had to design a user interface which will allow customers
					   to view all the information about the programs offered. This website was created using HTML and CSS
					   and is hosted on a GoDaddy server. There is one specific feature in the contact page which allows 
					   customers to send any questions or concerns about the program which was built using PHP.</p>
					<h3>Los Altos Hacks 2016</h3>
					<p>My team and I had created an Android app similiar to the chrome extension "momentum". This app allows users
					   to set tasks they wish to complete, shows the time, and displays an inspirational quote. Everytime the user
					   turns on their phone, the app automatically opens up to contantly remind the user of their tasks to complete
					   to discourage procrasination. </p>
					<h3>Hack UCI 2017</h3>
					<p>I created pong on android. While I was making this game, I learned a lot of fundemental concepts of android 
					   programming such as the use of intents and graphics. I changed the design of the pong game so it could have
					   a neon theme. </p>
					<h3>Data Science Exploration</h3>
					<p>I created a program using R which would gather demographic data of all counties in California. This data was 
					   public data which could be obtained through the California website. Similiarly, I gathered data on the average
					   household income for each county. I then compared the household income with the demographics of each county to see the demographics of the richest counties and the demographics of the poorest counties using a plot. I hope in the near future that I could perform some regressions on this data to get some more useful information. </p>
